TODO:
[x] horse individual page
[x] update horse, update alpaca
[x] login, signup
[x] make an ad
[x] delete horse, delete alpaca
[x] compete horses
[] create sales ad form
[] create new competition form
[] buy an horse
[] image upload form
[] resolve ads
[] add user id to nav bar after logged in

[] competition form page
[] competition update page

Don't do
[] Add state to paginations that need it
[] puzzle page 
[] quiz page

So I needed to have multiple create, delete, edit endpoints
[] horse: create, delete, edit endpoints
[] alpaca: create, delete, edit endpoints
[] image: add
[] salesAd: create, delete, edit endpoints
[] competition: create, delete, edit endpoints
